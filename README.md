# Analyze Submissions `(analyzeSubs.py)`
- Python Script that takes submissions.zip file and outputs an Excel spreadsheet to analyize data from submissions. 

- Program has two arguments to be passed when running:

  - First is the zipfile. The zipfile should either be in the current directory OR a path to the zipfile from the root directory.
 
  - Second is an optional argument that allows for either all submissions to be compiled or only the final submissions. By Default it will only compile the final submissions, so passing '-a' will compile all submissions.

- to run the file input should be: `user$: python3 analyzeSubs.py <zipfile or zipfile path> <-a>`


**Subs_anonymized.zip is a sample file**
